SNHU CS-210 Project 3

-Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers.
The problem this was solving was purely the convenience of the store of being able to look at the sales of the establishment. It was building a code that can read and write from files and be interactive again to see what sales are being made throughout the day.

-What did you do particularly well?

I did have a bit of a struggle with this project so in all honesty i think not giving up i did particularly well because it was really tough for me. I did a lot of fault checks and error checks and it was a lot of back and fourth deep diving in a lot of the code to make sure things where perfect which took quiet a bit of time. A lot of research occured especially since i had to do a fresh install of visual studio and python so i had to go back and implement everything together which was also a huge grind. 

-Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think enhancing my code would be nice in a way to make less lines and therefore would be more efficient. What i really want is to be able to just sit and type without thinking much and just be able to code like a second language %100.

-Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging thing was the implementation of python because the code i was writing was not taking and like i said before i had to re-implement python to visual studio all over again.

-What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Everything that we have learned from start to finish i feel with be able to be transfered over to other projects down the road.

-How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made sure that all the times was fluent and there was no out of place code that went back and fourth from each other. Step by step little by little to make it easy to read and maintainable.
